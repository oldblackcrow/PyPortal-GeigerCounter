In this version, I used ChatGPT to help make this a much better experience.
1. Added the PocketGeiger from www.radiation-watch.org/p/pocketgeiger.html I don't think they are still in stock, but you may be able to pick one up on eBay.
2. There are three tabs; Gamma (Radiation), Prox (Proximity - LIDAR Lite), and Delta (Adafruit LTR390 UV Light Sensor). If one is not plugged in, you get a message on the display stating, "Sensor not detected". This is much better than the who board crashing.
3. The UI is much improved and responsive. But it is customizable, so I'll be making changes to tweek it, but you may have a different design sense, so enjoy!
4. Unfortunately, the sacrifice to get get a geiger counter, is that you give up the Neopixel light since you have to use both 3-pin JST ports. One for power/ground/data and the other for just data (noise reduction). Maybe you can forgo the noise reduction, but miles may vary... do at your own risk.
